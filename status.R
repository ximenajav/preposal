#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far we have worked on the basic code for the battleship game and have set up a working game of battleship though it does not yet have any fancy graphics or twists.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not yet added anything additional to the bare bones of the battleship game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We've had to work through a few bugs with the code, but we are having the most issues with making the game have a twist do something extra to the basic game.
